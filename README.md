Imagine you're building a website for a portfolio, and you want to have a profile card element that
can be configured and reused easily, it's interactive and of course pretty.
- Implement a custom HTML element: Profile card -> &lt;profile-card> &lt;/profile-card>
    - Use Vanilla JS, CSS and HTML for your component
    - Add tests for the element, you can use selenium or follow a more challenging approach doing unit tests for it.
    - You can also get rid of NodeJS on your branch and start from scratch using only the plain technologies
    - What if you wanted it to preserve its own styling among websites?
